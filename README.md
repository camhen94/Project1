Turnovers Vs Wins Insights:
-reasonably strong negative correlation between wins and number of turnovers across all teams from 2003-2023 (r = -0.79) [aggregated data]
-the max number of wins accumulated from 2003-2023 was 241 by the New England Patriots
-the max number of turnovers accumulated from 2003-2023 was 601 by the Cleveland Browns
-the equation for the linear regression ws y=-0.51x+432.16 suggesting that an increase of one turnover was associated with about 1/2 less wins on average
-the NFC East appeared to have a weaker than average correlation between wins and turnovers (r = -0.38) 
-in our isolated NFC East yearly data it appeared the New York Giants demonstrated the weakest correlation between turnovers and wins (r = -0.11)
-the scatter plot showed the presence of high win & high turnover seasons which went against the general trend of the larger dataset

Does Passing or Running the ball have an impact on wins/loss of a team?
In order answer this questions we ran a correlation analysis and compared the total passing yards to wins and losses and the total rushing yards to wins and losses.
There was a slight positive correlation between passing yards/rush yards to wins which suggests teams that accumulate more passing or rushing yards, have a slightly higher chance to win the game.
There was a slight negative correlation between passing yards/rush yards to losses which suggests teams that accumulate more passing or rushing yards, a slightly less likely to lose. 
Something interesting to note is the correlation coefficient for passing and rushing yards are very similar. Based on those calculations we can determine:
 -Both passing and rushing yards matter.
 -Balance is key. Teams may benefit from having a balanced offensive apporach that incorporates both. This allows teams to adapt their strategy based on game situaion and make teams less predictable.
 -Factors such as opponent defense, game conditions, player injuries and coaching strategies have an influnce on the game, so while there is a positive correlation, we must remember that correlation is 
  not causation.
