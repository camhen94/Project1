##Turnovers Vs Wins Insights:
-reasonably strong negative correlation between wins and number of turnovers across all teams from 2003-2023 (r = -0.79) [aggregated data]
-the max number of wins accumulated from 2003-2023 was 241 by the New England Patriots
-the max number of turnovers accumulated from 2003-2023 was 601 by the Cleveland Browns
-the equation for the linear regression ws y=-0.51x+432.16 suggesting that an increase of one turnover was associated with about 1/2 less wins on average
-the NFC East appeared to have a weaker than average correlation between wins and turnovers (r = -0.38) 
-in our isolated NFC East yearly data it appeared the New York Giants demonstrated the weakest correlation between turnovers and wins (r = -0.11)
-the scatter plot showed the presence of high win & high turnover seasons which went against the general trend of the larger dataset

##Does Passing or Running the ball have an impact on wins/loss of a team?
In order answer this questions we ran a correlation analysis and compared the total passing yards to wins and losses and the total rushing yards to wins and losses.
There was a slight positive correlation between passing yards/rush yards to wins which suggests teams that accumulate more passing or rushing yards, have a slightly higher chance to win the game.
There was a slight negative correlation between passing yards/rush yards to losses which suggests teams that accumulate more passing or rushing yards, a slightly less likely to lose. 
Something interesting to note is the correlation coefficient for passing and rushing yards are very similar. Based on those calculations we can determine:
 -Both passing and rushing yards matter.
 -Balance is key. Teams may benefit from having a balanced offensive apporach that incorporates both. This allows teams to adapt their strategy based on game situaion and make teams less predictable.
 -Factors such as opponent defense, game conditions, player injuries and coaching strategies have an influnce on the game, so while there is a positive correlation, we must remember that correlation is 
  not causation.
##Yards Per Play vs Total Yards Analysis
- Teams with a average yards per play greater than the league average in a given year, on average had better winning percentages. However, having total yards greater than the league average in a year did not lead for greater averages in teams with yards per play less than the league average in a given year
- The correlation of Yards per Play to Margin of Victory was higher than the correlation of total yards and total plays, meaning a higher yard per play value will result in a greater expected winning percentag
- When controlling for total yards, the total number of plays has a negative correlation with margin of victory and win percentage. Thus, in theory, less plays with higher yards per play will lead to greater outcomes than more plays with less yards per play if the total yardage is equal.

Penalties vs Wins Insights and Conclusions: 

From 2003-2023 there is a moderately negative correlation between the number of penalties and the win percentage of teams. It is noticeable that as penalties for teams increase, their win percentage slightly decreases. When performing the pearson coefficient calculations we saw there was a -0.41 correlation coefficient between penalties and win percentage of teams which support our conclusions

We were interested in analyzing how penalties effect win percentage across different eras, thus we broke down our data further into shorter time increments. 

Breaking down our data into different eras showed the correlation of penalties to win percentage decreseases as time goes on. 

From 2003-2010, there was still a moderately negative correlation between the number of penalties and win percentage. Specifically, our correlation coefficient was calculated to be -0.4, which was similar to the data aggregated across 2003-2023. However, as time went on we noticed there was less of a correlation.

From 2010-2017, there was a weak negative correlation between the number of penalties and win percentage. Correlation coefficient in that era was -0.23 which supports our claims. 

The correlation factor significantly changed in our last era of comparison which was between 2018-2023. There was essentially no correlation between penalties and win percentage between 2018-2023. Our correlation coefficient was calculated to be 0.038 which supports our conclusion of little to no correlation.

In conclusion, between 2003-2023 there was a moderately negative correlation between the number of penalties and win percentage. However, when the data is broken down further it is easy to notice as time periods went on, there was a significantly less effect of penalties on win percentages of teams. 

There were minor outliers we noticed, however the outliers supported our claims of penalties negatively affecting win percentage. As noticeable in the 2003-2023 graph, the team with the single highest penalties had the second worst win percentage, and the team with the single lowest penalties had the best win percentage. 

Assumption factors: 
When we draw conclusions based on penalties and win percentages, we assume the players average abilities are the same on each team. i.e. the same players play on the same teams. In our analysis there are many factors which could skew this data so it is important to keep this assumption in mind when we are attempting to solely analyze effect of penalties on teams win percentages.
